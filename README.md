# Square-Game
Final Group Project for Digital Systems Design - EE3564. This project utilizes the VGA module from the Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 to output video of a game created using Verilog
Xilinx Vivado. Purpose of this game is for the user to control a literal colored square and using the touch button d-pad that is already embedded on the FPGA, the square
has to move to its destination, which is a colored square located at the other side of the screen. Please refer to the .mp4 for a working demo. This project was divided 
in 3 different source files.
